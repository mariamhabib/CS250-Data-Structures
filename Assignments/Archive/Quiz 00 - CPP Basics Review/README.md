# C++ Review Quiz

Assess your competency with C++ using this quiz during the first week of class.


## Coding Questions

These are very barebones examples of each concept. You should have minimum difficulty
writing these.


### Variable Declarations

1. Declare a variable to represent an item's price. Its data type should be a float or a double. Assign it the value of $9.99.

2. Declare a variable to represent a student's name. Its data type should be a string. Assign it a value of "Grace".

3. Declare a variable to represent the count of items in stock in a store. Its data type should be an integer. Assign it the value of 100.


### Control Flow

#### 2. If/Else

Write an if statement that will test a boolean variable named **hasError**.

    * If it is true, then return -1.
    * If it is false, then return 0.


#### 3. If/Else If/Else

Write an if statement that will follow this logic:

    * if the rating is "E", then set canBuyGame to true.
    
    * If the rating is "T" and age is greater than 12, then set canBuyGame to true.
    
    * if the rating is "AO" and the age is greater than 17, then set canBuyGame to true.
    
    * otherwise, set canBuyGame to false.

#### 4. While Loop

Write a while loop. While a variable named "age" is less than 15...

    * Add 1 to age
    * Display the message "For turning (age), you received $20 from grandma!"
    
Once the loop has ended, display a message "You're too old to get birthday money now."

#### 5. For Loop

Write a for loop. It should start at the number 10 (including 10), and go down
to the number 5 (including 5), subtracting 1 from the iterator variable each time.

Within the loop, display the value of the iterator variable.


### Functions

#### 6. Void with no parameters

Write a function whose return type is void, and its name is "DisplayMainMenu".
It has no parameters.

Within the function, it should display a list:

1. Play
2. Load
3. Help
4. Quit

#### 7. Return type and parameters

Write a function whose return type is a string. It also takes two parameters, which are also strings: "firstName" and "lastName".

Within the function, it should format the name to show the last name, then a comma, then the first name. This is the return value.

Example, if first name is "Grace" and last name is "Hopper", then the return value is "Hopper, Grace".

You can use + to do string concatenations.

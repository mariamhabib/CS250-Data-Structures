## Rules

* Team size: 1 person
    * You can brainstorm with others - that is, you can verbally discuss the problem.
    * You cannot copy another person's work. Code will be checked against other submissions with a diff tool. If a copy is found, both people will receive a 0 on the assignment.
* Open book / open note - do research as-needed.

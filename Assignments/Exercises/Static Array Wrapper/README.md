## Downloads

Download the starter files for this project.

* Visual Studio project

Or you can download the files directly on GitHub:

* []()

## Rules

* Team size: 1 person
    * You can brainstorm with others - that is, you can verbally discuss the problem.
    * You cannot copy another person's work. Code will be checked against other submissions with a diff tool. If a copy is found, both people will receive a 0 on the assignment.
* Open book / open note - do research as-needed.

## Overview

The starter files contain the stub for the Smart Array, with functions
that need to be implemented.

The project also contains tester files that you can use to judge
whether your functions are working properly.

## Turn in

Once you're done, upload all source files (.cpp, .hpp, .h) to the class dropbox
and up on your GitHub page.

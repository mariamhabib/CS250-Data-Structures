# Instructions

## 1. Search algorithm

In the starter code, a linear search is already implemented.

Try to brainstorm with a classmate on how to make an algorithm
that is more efficient than checking one item at a time, from
the start to the end.

Implement a custom search function, and make sure you output
how many iterations it took to find the result.

## 2. Sorting the data

A smart search algorithm is easier to come up with if the
list of data is sorted. There are many sorting algorithms.

Brainstorm with a classmate on how to make a sorting algorithm
without referencing existing sorting algorithms.

Try to implement a custom sorting function, and make sure you
output how many iterations it took to sort the array.

## 3. Sorting algorithms

Look at some of the following Wiki pages for algorithms:

* [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)

Each of these pages have pseudocode available to reference.
Implement one of these algorithms, adapting the pseudocode to
work with your data.

Make sure to add a counter that outputs how many iterations it took
to sort the data afterward.

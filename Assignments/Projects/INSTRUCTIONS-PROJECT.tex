Homework projects should be worked on by each individual student.
Brainstorming and sketching out problems on paper or on a whiteboard
together are permitted, but \underline{do not} copy code from someone else
or allow your code to be copied. Students who commit or aid in plagiarism will
receive a 0\% on the assignment and be reported.

        \paragraph{Topics:} \laTopics

        \paragraph{Turn in:}
            Turn in all source files - .cpp, .hpp, and/or .h files.
            \textbf{Do not turn in Visual Studio files}.

        \paragraph{Starter files:} \laStarterFiles

        \paragraph{Building and running:} If you are using Visual Studio,
            make sure to run \underline{with} debugging. (Don't run without debugging!)
            Using the debugger will help you find errors. \\
            To prevent a program exit, use this before \texttt{return 0;}
\begin{verbatim}
cin.ignore();
cin.get();
\end{verbatim}

        \paragraph{Tips:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   \underline{Always make sure it builds.}
                        Only add a few lines of code at a time and build
                        after each small change to ensure your program still builds.
                        
                \item   \underline{One feature at a time.}
                        Only implement one feature (or one function) at a time.
                        Make sure it builds, runs, and works as intended before
                        moving on to the next feature.
                        
                \item   \underline{Search for build errors.}
                        Chances are someone else has had the same build error before.
                        Copy the message into a search engine and look for information
                        on \textit{why} it occurs, and \textit{how} to resolve it.

                \item   \underline{Use debug tools,} such as breakpoints,
                        stack trace, and variable watch.
                
                \item   \underline{Don't implement everything in one go.}
                        Don't just try typing out all the code in one go
                        without building, running, and testing. It will be
                        much harder to debug if you've tried to program everything all at once.

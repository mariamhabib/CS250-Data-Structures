    \section{About}

        For this first project, we will step through implementing
        a bag object with a static array. This project will be a bit
        hand-holdey, so you can get used to the tools and basics of
        coding in C++.

        You can also use Chapter 3 of the textbook for additional information
        on how to implement these functions.

    \section{Project specifications}

        \subsection{Setting up an IDE}

            IDE stands for ``Integrated Development Environment''. An IDE
            is a program that contains the text editor for code, as well
            as some project management tools and debugging tools.

            We will step through how to create a project in both Visual Studio
            and in Code::Blocks. If you're working on your own computer,
            you can get a free version of Visual Studio Community Edition. If
            VS is too bulky or slow, or if you're not running Windows, then
            Code::Blocks is a good option as well.

            \paragraph{Visual Studio:}
                \texttt{https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/}

            \paragraph{Code::Blocks:}
                \texttt{http://codeblocks.org/downloads/26}

                Note: If installing for Windows, download the version that
                says ``mingw-setup.exe''.

        \subsection{Creating a project}

            \subsubsection{In Visual Studio}

                When you first open up Visual Studio, it will have a welcome page.
                You can select New Project from here, or from File $>$ New $>$ Project...

                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=5cm]{images-2018-01/vs-newproject.png}
                    %\caption{The ``New Project...'' button in Visual Studio}
                \end{figure}

                On the New Project dialog window, make sure to select Visual C++ on the left side,
                and then Empty Project in the middle pane.
                (Note: You might have to install additional files to use C++)

                Set the project Name and Location at the bottom.
                
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{images-2018-01/vs-newproject2.png}
                    %\caption{Selecting ``Empty Project'' and setting Name and Location.}
                \end{figure}

                Afterwards, click on OK.

                The project is created, but will be empty and contain no source files.

                To add an empty file, In the Solution Explorer, right-click your project file and go to Add $>$ New Item...

                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{images-2018-01/vs-addnewitem.png}
                    %\caption{Selecting ``Empty Project'' and setting Name and Location.}
                \end{figure}

                If you're creating the file to store your main() function, select the C++ File.
                
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{images-2018-01/vs-newcpp.png}
                    %\caption{Selecting ``Empty Project'' and setting Name and Location.}
                \end{figure}

                Give it a name, and click Add.

            \newpage

            \subsubsection{In Code::Blocks}

                When you first open up Code::Blocks, it will have a welcome page.
                You can select Create a new project from here, or from File $>$ New $>$ Project...
            
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{images-2018-01/codeblocks_newproject.png}
                \end{figure}

                On the New from template window that pops up, select Empty project and click Go.
            
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images-2018-01/codeblocks_emptyproject.png}
                \end{figure}

                \newpage

                On the next screen...
            
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images-2018-01/codeblocks_newproject_dialog.png}
                \end{figure}

                first click ``...'' and select a directory where you want to store your project folder.

                After you have done so, give your project a title - a folder will be created for it automatically.

                Then click Next.

                \newpage

                The next window asks about Debug and Release options - leave these as the defaults and click Finish.
            
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images-2018-01/codeblocks_debugrelease.png}
                \end{figure}

                The project will be empty. To add a new file, do the following:

                Go to File $>$ New $>$ Empty file.

                It will ask, ``Do you want to add this new file in the active project (has to be saved first)?''
                Click on ``yes'' and save your source file. Make sure the filename ends with ``.cpp''.
                Click ``Save'' once done making the file.
            
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images-2018-01/codeblocks_newfile.png}
                \end{figure}

                Another window pops up asking about debug and release. Leave these both checked and click Ok.
            
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images-2018-01/codeblocks_debugagain.png}
                \end{figure}

        \section{Creating files}

            For this project, you will need to make two files: A .cpp file to store your program code,
            and a header file, ``Bag.hpp''. Your .cpp file can have any name, such as ``project1.cpp'',
            ``main.cpp'', etc.

            \begin{intro}{Why .hpp?}
                Many C++ programmers will name their header files with the .h extension, but some use
                .hpp. A common reason for this is if you're writing code FOR C++, not for C AND C++ together.
                Some libraries were written in C but can be used in both languages, while libraries
                written IN C++ and FOR C++ may opt to use ``.hpp'' as their header extensions.
            \end{intro}

        \newpage

        \section{Starter code}

            In your .cpp source file, let's start out with some basic code.
            Type out the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code]
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "Bag.hpp"

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;

    // Don't let the program stop immediately
    cin.ignore();
    cin.get();

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

            \paragraph{Visual Studio:} To build and run in Visual Studio, click on the ``Local Windows Debugger'' button or hit F5.
        
            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering
                \includegraphics{images-2018-01/vs-play.png}
            \end{figure}

            It may ask if you want to build first before you run. Click on Yes -- You will always want to click on Yes here.

            If the build fails, it will ask if you still want to run - say NO. Otherwise, if the build was successful, it will run your program.

            \begin{error}{Always run with the debugger}
                In the past, you might have gone through the dropdown menu and
                started your program \textit{without} debugging so that the program
                wouldn't exit immediately. \textbf{DON'T DO THIS.}
                The debugger gives you invaluable tools for fidning errors and dealing
                with crashes.
            \end{error}

            ~\\
            \paragraph{Code::Blocks:} To build and run in Code::Blocks, click on the ``Build and run'' button, or hit F9.
            
            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering
                \includegraphics{images-2018-01/codeblocks_buildrun.png}
            \end{figure}

            Make sure the program builds and runs before continuing.

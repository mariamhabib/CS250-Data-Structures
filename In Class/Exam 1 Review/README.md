# Exam 1 Review

## Rules

For the exam, it is **Solo Effort**. Students must use the lab computers
in the classroom while taking the exam; personal computers are not allowed.

Students **may** use their **textbook** (physical book, or ebook),
and they **may** use their notes from the **note templates** (electronic version only)
during the exam.

Students will be monitored from the instructor computer while the exam is in progress.

Students **may** use Visual Studio as-needed, but in general it will not be needed.

## Topics

1. C++ Review
1. Debugging Tools
1. Testing & Design
1. Recursion
1. Array-based structures
1. Link-based structures

Most of the questions are based off the note templates.

The questions are multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blank, and essay questions.

### C++ Review

* Know how pointers work, dynamic variables, and dynamic arrays, and how to code them.

### Debugging Tools

* Be familiar with the basic debugging tools: Breakpoints, autos/locals/watch windows, call stack.

### Design

* Be familiar with how testing is used, why writing tests prior to implementing code can be a good design decision.
* Class design, such as:
    * When to use Const member functions
    * When to use Const parameters in a function
    * Private, protected, and public members
    * Pros of using source control

### Recursion

* Minimum required parts of a recursive function; base-case and recursive-case. How to tell them apart.
* Recursion errors, like Stack Overflow - how do you cause it, and why does it occur?

### Arrays and Linked Lists

* Efficiency of the add / remove / search functions for each (but not in terms of *O(n)*, which we haven't covered yet.)
* Design decisions behind how to build an array-based data structure
* Knowing random access vs. sequential access, for which structures
* High-level knowledge of the difference between singly, doubly, and circularly linked lists.
* Be able to diagram the elements of a list after some PushBack / PushFront / PopBack / PopFront commands.

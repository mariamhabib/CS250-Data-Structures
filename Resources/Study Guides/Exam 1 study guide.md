# Data structures

## Knowledge

* Why do we build data structures? Why are there different types of structures?

## Vocabulary

* Interface
* Coupling
* Cohesion
* Method
* Class
* Object
* Instance/Instantiation

# STL structures

## Knowledge

* A vector is implemented with…
  * How to add items to a vector
  * How to access items in a vector
* A list is implemented with…
* Functional differences between list and vector

## Vocabulary

# Static arrays 

## Knowledge

* What are the “dangers” of using a static array? What kind of validation do you need to do to ensure the structure can’t crash the program?
* How are arrays stored in memory? Why can’t static arrays be resized?

## Vocabulary

# Dynamic arrays

## Knowledge

* What are the “dangers” of using a dynamic array? What kind of validation do you need to do to ensure the structure can’t crash the program?
* When do dynamic arrays hit a speed bottleneck?
* Steps to “resize” a dynamic array
* Where local variables are allocated in memory vs. where dynamic variables are allocated.

## Vocabulary

# Pointers and memory management

## Knowledge

* How to declare a pointer, assign an address to it, accessing the value it is pointing to.
* Dynamic variables vs. arrays – allocating memory, freeing memory, accessing data at the address.
* Utilization of “NULL” or “nullptr” - why?
* Types of memory errors

## Vocabulary

* Stack
* Heap
* Address-of operator
* De-reference operator
* Member-access operator

# Linked lists

## Knowledge

* The anatomy of a Node class and a Linked List class
* How much space does a linked list need? How does it expand?
* Knowledge of how the following works (should understand how to be able to derive the code later):
  * Push (to back)
  * Pop (from back)
  * Insert (at index)
  * Remove (at index)
  * Operator== to Compare two linked lists

## Vocabulary

* Node
* Singly-linked list
* Doubly-linked list

# Algorithm efficiency

## Knowledge

* How to estimate the worst-case efficiency of an algorithm (given code).

## Vocabulary

* O(n)
* Linear
* Quadratic
* Exponential
* Logarithmic

# Data structures

## Knowledge

* Why do we build data structures? Why are there different types of structures?

## Vocabulary

* Interface
* Coupling
* Cohesion
* Method
* Class
* Object
* Instance/Instantiation

# STL structures

## Knowledge

* A vector is implemented with…
  * How to add items to a vector

* Functional differences between list and vector

## Vocabulary

# Static arrays 

[CS 200 Lecture slides - Arrays](https://github.com/Rachels-Courses/CS200-Concepts-of-Progamming-Algorithms/blob/master/Resources/Lecture%20Slides/08%20Arrays/Arrays.pdf) | [CS 200 Lecture video - Arrays](http://edu.moosader.com/_CPP_LECTURES/08%20Arrays%20Lecture.mp4)

## Knowledge

* What are the “dangers” of using a static array? What kind of validation do you need to do to ensure the structure can’t crash the program?
* How are arrays stored in memory? Why can’t static arrays be resized?
* What are things we need to keep in mind when using static arrays? (Error checking?)

# Pointers and memory management

[CS 200 Lecture slides - Memory management](https://github.com/Rachels-Courses/CS200-Concepts-of-Progamming-Algorithms/blob/master/Resources/Lecture%20Slides/12%20Pointers/Memory%20Management.pdf) | [CS 200 Lecture video - Memory management](http://edu.moosader.com/_CPP_LECTURES/17%20Memory%20Management%20Lecture.mp4)

## Knowledge

* How to declare a pointer, assign an address to it, accessing the value it is pointing to.
* Dynamic variables vs. arrays – allocating memory, freeing memory, accessing data at the address.
* Utilization of “NULL” or “nullptr” - why?
* Types of memory errors

## Vocabulary

* Stack
* Heap
* Address-of operator
* De-reference operator
* Member-access operator

## Vocabulary

# Dynamic arrays

[CS 200 Lecture slides - Dynamic arrays](https://github.com/Rachels-Courses/CS200-Concepts-of-Progamming-Algorithms/blob/master/Resources/Lecture%20Slides/12%20Pointers/Dynamic%20Arrays.pdf) | [CS 200 Lecture video - Dynamic arrays](http://edu.moosader.com/_CPP_LECTURES/18%20Dynamic%20Arrays%20Lecture.mp4)

## Knowledge

* What are the “dangers” of using a dynamic array? What kind of validation do you need to do to ensure the structure can’t crash the program?
* When do dynamic arrays hit a speed bottleneck?
* Steps to “resize” a dynamic array
* Where local variables are allocated in memory vs. where dynamic variables are allocated.

## Vocabulary



# Linked lists

## Knowledge

* The anatomy of a Node class and a Linked List class

  * Pop (from back)
  * Insert (at index)
  * Remove (at index)
  * Operator== to Compare two linked lists

## Vocabulary

# Algorithm efficiency

## Knowledge

* How to estimate the worst-case efficiency of an algorithm (given code).

## Vocabulary

* O(n)
* Linear
* Quadratic
* Exponential
* Logarithmic
